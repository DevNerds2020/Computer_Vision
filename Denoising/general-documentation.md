# Step 1: Noise Generation
1.**Gaussian Noise:** 
Add Gaussian noise to images using a function that generates random numbers following a Gaussian distribution. You can control the amount of noise by adjusting the standard deviation.

2.**Salt and Pepper Noise:**
Introduce random white and black pixels (salt and pepper noise) to the images. You can control the density of these pixels to adjust the severity of the noise.

3.**Speckle Noise:**
Apply speckle noise by multiplying the image by a random matrix with values following a uniform distribution centered around 1. Again, control the intensity of noise.

4.**Poisson Noise:**
Simulate Poisson noise by adding random values sampled from a Poisson distribution to the pixel values in the images.

# Step 2: Denoising Techniques

After introducing various types of noise to the images in Step 1, the next step involves applying denoising techniques to restore the original quality of the images. Here are some common denoising methods:

1. **Gaussian Smoothing:**
   Use a Gaussian filter to smooth the images and reduce the impact of Gaussian noise. Adjust the filter size to control the amount of smoothing applied.

2. **Median Filtering:**
   Apply median filtering to remove salt and pepper noise. This technique involves replacing each pixel value with the median value of its neighboring pixels. The window size can be adjusted based on the noise density.

# Step 3: Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the denoising techniques using quantitative metrics such as:

- **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):**
  Calculate the PSNR to measure the quality of denoised images compared to the original images. Higher PSNR values indicate better denoising performance.

- **Structural Similarity Index (SSI):**
  Assess the structural similarity between the original and denoised images using the SSIM metric. A higher SSIM value indicates better preservation of structures.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
  Compute the MSE to quantify the average squared difference between the original and denoised images. Lower MSE values correspond to better denoising.

# Step 4: Results and Discussion

Present the results obtained from applying each denoising technique to the noisy images. Compare the performance of these techniques based on the evaluation metrics mentioned above. Discuss the strengths and limitations of each method in handling specific types of noise.

# Step 5: Conclusion

Summarize the findings and highlight the most effective denoising techniques for the types of noise introduced in Step 1. Provide recommendations for selecting denoising methods based on the characteristics of the noise present in different scenarios. Mention any potential areas for further research or improvement in denoising algorithms.
